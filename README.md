## ðŸ§  What is Mad Libs?

**Mad Libs** is a word-based party game that combines creativity and grammar in a fun, unpredictable way.

### ðŸŽ® How It Works

1. One player is prompted to provide random words â€” such as:
   - nouns (`dog`, `pizza`)
   - adjectives (`slimy`, `colorful`)
   - verbs (`run`, `dancing`)
2. The other player (or the game) inserts those words into blank spaces in a pre-written story **without revealing the full context**.
3. Once all blanks are filled, the story is read aloud â€” usually resulting in a **funny and absurd** version of the original!

### ðŸ“š Example

Before:
> "Today I went to the \_\_\_ (noun) and saw a \_\_\_ (adjective) \_\_\_ (noun)."

After:
> "Today I went to the **zoo** and saw a **sparkly** **cactus**."

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Mad Libs is often used to:
- Practice parts of speech (useful for language learning)
- Encourage creativity and humor
- Break the ice in groups or classrooms
